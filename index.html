    <h1>Tracey Radcliffe</h1>
    <h2>Aspiring Web Developer</br></br></h2>

    <h2>A little background</h2>
    <p>
      I grew up in a little town called Allyn, on the Olympic Penninsula. It is pretty much 2 coffee shops, 2 restaurants, a gas station, and your gone. Now I live on Capitol Hill, with my S.O. and a cat, Minerva.
    </br>
      My family is local, with my little brother and newphew across the Puget Sound and my mother in Olympia. 
    </br>
      I love to read. Exploring new worlds within books is the closest I can get to my other passion, traveling, while I am here in Seattle. I travel as much and as often as I can. I try and travel locally, regionally, and internationaly every year. Travel teaches me something new each time I go someplace, whether it is a new custom or parts of a new langauge, I am constantly learning while getting myself out of my comfort zone.
